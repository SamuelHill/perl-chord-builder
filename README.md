# Perl chord builder

Simple chord builder in Perl. Gives the notes in a chord based on the quality (major, minor, diminished, augmented, and a major seventh) and the note name - accepting up to 2 accidentals (one whole step) for enharmonic note names.

Some of the first code I wrote to practice programming at university back in 2012. Additionally used to help me practice music theory.

Works still as of 2022.
